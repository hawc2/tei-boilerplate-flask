                        <p>IF Poverty be a Title to Poetry, I am sure No-body can dispute mine. I
                            own myself of the Company of Beggars; and I make one at their Weekly
                            Festivals at St. <placeName ref="#Giles" rend="italics">Giles</placeName>â€™s. I have a small Yearly
                            Salary for my Catches, and am welcome to a Dinner there whenever I
                            please, which is more than most Poets can say.</p>

                        <p>As we live by the Muses, â€™tis but Gratitude in us to encourage Poetical
                            Merit where-ever we find it. The Muses, contrary to all other Ladies,
                            pay no Distinction to Dress, and never partially mistake the Pertness of
                            Embroidery for Wit, nor the Modesty of Want for Dulness. Be the Author
                            who he will, we push his Play as far as it will go. So (though you are
                            in Want) I wish you Success heartily.</p>

                        <p>This Piece I own was originally writ for the celebrating the Marriage of
                                <hi rend="italics">James Chanter</hi> and <hi rend="italics">Moll
                                Lay</hi>, two most excellent Ballad-Singers. I have introducâ€™d the
                            Similes that are in all your celebrated <hi rend="italics">Operas:</hi>
                            The <hi rend="italics">Swallow,</hi> the <hi rend="italics">Moth</hi>,
                            the <hi rend="italics">Bee</hi>, the <hi rend="italics">Ship</hi>, the
                                <hi rend="italics">Flower</hi>, &amp;c. Besides, I have a Prison
                            Scene which the Ladies always reckon charmingly pathetick. As to the
                            Parts, I have observâ€™d such a nice Impartiality to our two Ladies, that
                            it is impossible for either of them to take Offence. I hope I may be
                            forgiven, that I have not made my Opera throughout unnatural, like those
                            in vogue; for I have no Recitative: Excepting this, as I have consented
                            to have neither Prologue nor Epilogue, it must be allowâ€™d an Opera in
                            all its forms. The Piece indeed hath been heretofore frequently
                            represented by ourselves in our great Room at St. <placeName ref="#Giles" rend="italics">Giles</placeName>â€™s, so that I cannot too often acknowledge your Charity
                            in bringing it now on the Stage.</p>

                                Gold Watches, and seven Silver ones. A mighty clean-handed Fellow!
                                Sixteen Snuff-boxes, five of them of true Gold. Six dozen of
                                Handkerchiefs, four silver-hilted Swords, half a dozen of Shirts,
                                three Tye-Perriwigs, and a Piece of Broad Cloth. Considering these
                                are only the Fruits of his leisure Hours, I don't know a prettier
                                Fellow, for no Man alive hath a more engaging Presence of Mind upon
                                the Road. Wat Dreary, alias Brown Will, an irregular Dog, who hath
                                an underhand way of disposing of his Goods. I'll try him only for a
                                Sessions or two longer upon his good Behaviour. Harry Padington, a
                                poor petty-larceny Rascal, without the least Genius; that Fellow,
                                though he were to live these six Months, will never come to the
                                Gallows with any Credit. Slippery Sam; he goes off the next
                                Sessions, for the Villain hath the Impudence to have views of
                                following his Trade as a Taylor, which he calls an honest
                                Employment. Matt of the Mint; listed not above a Month ago, a
                                promising sturdy Fellow, and diligent in his way; somewhat too bold
                                and hasty, and may raise good Contributions on the Publick, if he
                                does not cut himself short by Murder. Tom. Tipple, a guzzling
                                soaking Sot, who is always too drunk to stand himself, or to make
                                others stand. A Cart is absolutely necessary for him. Robin of
                                Bagshot, alias Gorgon, alias Bluff Bob, alias Carbuncle, alias Bob
                                Booty.</p>

                            <p>Murder is as fashionable a Crime as a Man can be guilty of. How many

                                done upon this Subject. Was Captain Macheath here this Morning, for

                                Livelihood to grant every Liberty but one. You see I would indulge
                                the Girl as far as prudently we can. In any thing, but Marriage!
                                After that, my Dear, how shall we be safe? Are we not then in her
                                Husband's Power? For a Husband hath the absolute Power over all a
                                Wife's Secrets but her own. If the Girl had the Discretion of a
                                Court Lady, who can have a dozen young Fellows at her Ear without
                                complying with one, I should not matter it; but Polly is Tinder, and
                                a Spark will at once set her on a Flame. Married! If the Wench does
                                not know her own Profit, sure she knows her own Pleasure better than
                                to make herself a Property! My Daughter to me should be, like a
                                Court Lady to a Minister of State, a Key to the whole Gang. Married!
                                If the Affair is not already done, I'll terrify her from it, by the

                            <p>But 'tis your Duty, my Dear, to warn the Girl against her Ruin, and
                                to instruct her how to make the most of her Beauty. I'll go to her
                                this moment, and sift her. In the mean time, Wife, rip out the
                                Coronets and Marks of these dozen of Cambric Handkerchiefs, for I
                                can dispose of them this Afternoon to a Chap in the City.</p>

                        <p>Never was a Man more out of the way in an Argument than my Husband! Why
                            must our Polly, forsooth, differ from her Sex, and love only her
                            Husband? And why must Polly's Marriage, contrary to all Observation,
                            make her the less followed by other Men? All Men are Thieves in Love,
                            and like a Woman the better for being another's Property.</p>

                                thou wilt be a great Man in History. Where was your Post last Night,

                                Catechism; for really a Man makes but an ill Figure in the

                                whoring? have you Money enough to carry on the daily Quarrels of Man
                                and Wife about who shall squander most? There are not many Husbands

                                into our Family but a Highwayman? Why, thou foolish Jade, thou wilt

                                For I lent it to Suky Straddle, to make a Figure with it to-night at
                                a Tavern in <placeName ref="#Drury">Drury-Lane</placeName>. If t'other Gentleman calls for the

                                doth not come from Tunbridge till Tuesday Night; so that it cannot

                                Hope that keeps up a Wife's Spirits. Where is the Woman who would
                                scruple to be a Wife, if she had it in her Power to be a Widow
                                whenever she pleas'd? If you have any Views of this sort, Polly, I

                                like that we should get the Reward for his Death sooner than a
                                Stranger. Why, Polly, the Captain knows, that as 'tis his Employment
                                to rob, so 'tis ours to take Robbers; every Man in his Business. So
                                that there is no Malice in the Case.</p>

                                and Spirit; they make charming Mistresses, but plaguy
                                Wives.----Betty Doxy! Come hither, Hussy. Do you drink as hard as
                                ever? You had better stick to good wholesome Beer; for in troth,
                                Betty, Strong-Waters will in time ruin your Constitution. You should

                            <p>The hard Times oblige me to go very near in my Dealing.To be sure, of
                                late Years I have been a great Sufferer by the Parliament.Three
                                thousand Pounds would hardly make me amends.The Act for destroying
                                the <placeName ref="#Mint">Mint</placeName>, was a severe Cut upon our BusinessTill then, if a Customer
                                stept out of the way we knew where to have herNo doubt you know Mrs.
                                Coaxertheres a Wench now (till to-day) with a good Suit of Cloaths
                                of mine upon her Back, and I could never set Eyes upon her for three
                                Months together.Since the Act too against Imprisonment for small
                                Sums, my Loss there too hath been very considerable, and it must be
                                so, when a Lady can borrow a handsome Petticoat, or a clean Gown,
                                and I not have the least Hank upon her! And, o my Conscience,
                                now-a-days most Ladies take a Delight in cheating, when they can do
                                it with Safety.</p>

                            <p>Consider, Mr. Peachum, that Watch was remarkable, and not of very
                                safe Sale.If you have any black Velvet Scarfsthey are a handsome
                                Winter-wear; and take with most Gentlemen who deal with my
                                Customers.Tis I that put the Ladies upon a good Foot. Tis not Youth
                                or Beauty that fixes their Price. The Gentlemen always pay according
                                to their Dress, from half a Crown to two Guineas; and yet those
                                Hussies make nothing of bilking of me.Then too, allowing for
                                Accidents.I have eleven fine Customers now down under the Surgeons
                                Hands,--what with Fees and other Expences, there are great
                                Goings-out, and no Comings-in, and not a Farthing to pay for at

                            <p> But, honest Friend, I hope you dont intend that Macheath shall be
                                really executed.</p>

                            <p> Most certainly, Sir.To make the Piece perfect, I was for doing
                                strict poetical Justice.Macheath is to be hangd; and for the other
                                Personages of the Drama, the Audience must have supposd they were
                                all either hangd or transported.</p>

                            <p> Why then, Friend, this is a down-right deep Tragedy. The Catastrophe
                                is manifestly wrong, for an Opera must end happily.</p>

                            <p> Your Objection, Sir, is very just; and is easily removd. For you
                                must allow, that in this kind of Drama, tis no matter how absurdly
                                things are brought about.Soyou Rabble thererun and cry a Reprievelet

                            <p> Through the whole Piece you may observe such a similitude of Manners
                                in high and low Life, that it is difficult to determine whether (in
                                the fashionable Vices) the fine Gentlemen imitate the Gentlemen of
                                the Road, or the Gentlemen of the Road the fine Gentlemen.Had the
                                Play remaind, as I at first intended, it would have carried a most
                                excellent Moral. Twould have shown that the lower Sort of People
                                have their Vices in a degree as well as the Rich: And that they are
                                punishd for them.</p>
